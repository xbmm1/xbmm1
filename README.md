# Brian McHorney – Junior Software Developer

I’m a junior software developer focused on backend and cloud-native systems, with a growing interest in fintech, algorithms, and scalable application design. I learn best by building projects end-to-end and breaking systems down until they make sense.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

I’m expanding my software engineering skills with a focus on **AWS and serverless architectures**. Recently, I built and deployed an **AWS Image Thumbnail Generator**, a serverless web application that uses **Lambda, S3, API Gateway, IAM, and CloudWatch** to securely upload images and automatically generate thumbnails using event-driven workflows.

Alongside hands-on development, I’m actively shadowing software engineering teams to better understand **DevOps practices, CI/CD concepts, and Agile workflows**, and how production systems are actually designed, deployed, and maintained.

## 🧠 Education & Training

### ASU FinTech Bootcamp (24-week, part-time, online)

I have completed the **ASU FinTech Bootcamp**, a 24-week program designed for working professionals and career changers entering the fintech space. The program focuses on practical, project-based learning and portfolio development.

**Core areas of study include:**
- **Python programming** for data analysis, automation, and financial applications  
  (Pandas, NumPy, and finance-focused workflows)
- **Machine learning in finance**, including predictive modeling, risk analysis, and algorithmic trading concepts
- **Blockchain development**, with hands-on exposure to Ethereum and Solidity smart contracts
- **Financial analysis and modeling**, including corporate finance fundamentals and quantitative modeling
- **SQL and data management** for working with structured financial datasets
- **Real-world projects**, culminating in a portfolio of finance-related and technical work

The bootcamp emphasized applying concepts to real problems rather than memorization, which helped me connect software engineering principles with financial systems.

## 🔧 I’m actively practicing

- Implementing and visualizing algorithms (A*, graph theory, modular arithmetic, RSA) through hands-on projects
- Designing and benchmarking AI strategies, including multiple solvers for the **2048 game** with 1000-game simulations, Demo: [2048 Game](https://xbmm1.github.io/2048/2048-with-scores.html)
- Writing clean, testable logic using **pure functions** and clear separation of concerns
- Building interactive visualizations for math, physics, and data concepts using HTML, JavaScript, and canvas/WebGL
- Applying software design patterns (strategy pattern, closures, immutable state) in small projects
- Deploying and iterating on personal projects to understand real-world debugging, performance, and trade-offs

---

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

- Deeper algorithm and data structure concepts, including pathfinding and discrete math fundamentals
- Applied cryptography, such as RSA and modular arithmetic
- Practical AI heuristics and evaluation functions
- Financial modeling and machine learning concepts as applied to real-world finance problems
- Cloud and backend design patterns for building scalable systems

## 🛠️ Projects

### AWS Image Thumbnail Generator
A serverless web application that automatically generates image thumbnails.

**What it demonstrates:**
- Event-driven architecture using **S3 triggers and Lambda**
- Secure uploads using **presigned URLs**
- REST APIs built with **API Gateway**
- Permission management with **IAM**
- Monitoring and debugging with **CloudWatch**

Live demo: [AWS Image Thumbnail Generator](http://image-thumbnail-app-brian.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com)  
Key learnings: serverless architecture, event-driven workflows, secure file handling, and API integration

---

### Algorithm & Visualization Demos (HTML / JS)

I maintain a growing collection of small projects and demos focused on:
- **Algorithms and number theory** (RSA, modular arithmetic, A*, graph-related visualizations)
- **Mathematical and cryptographic concepts**
- **Physics simulations and 2D engines**
- **Fractals, shaders, and graphical experiments**
- **Data visualization and graphing**

These projects continue to help me practice algorithms and problem-solving beyond the ASU FinTech Bootcamp by implementing and visualizing ideas step by step.

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on

Cloud-native or serverless projects, backend applications, fintech-related ideas, and algorithm-focused builds. I’m especially interested in projects that value **clean code, clear APIs, automation, and thoughtful problem solving**.

---

## 🤝 I’m looking for help with

- Advanced **AWS architecture patterns**
- **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Building and improving **CI/CD pipelines**
- Security best practices and deployment strategies for scalable systems

---

## 💬 Ask me about

AWS fundamentals and serverless development, building APIs with **Lambda and API Gateway**, **S3 event-driven workflows**, Python for automation and backend logic, designing and benchmarking simple AI strategies, algorithm fundamentals (A*, RSA, heuristics), and how I break down complex technical ideas into clear, working implementations.
